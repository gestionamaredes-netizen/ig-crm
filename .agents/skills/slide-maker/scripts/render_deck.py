    meaning one thing. Zero hard findings, zero warnings, every hand-off gate passed. The
    semantic-colour contract is a required plan FIELD and nothing compared it to the pixels.

    Building a user profile from scratch is most of what a headless `--convert-to` run spends
    its time on: measured 3.71s per export with a fresh profile against 2.16s once the profile
    already exists — ~42% of the export, on every render, spent recreating the same directory.

    The old code paid that every time by design, and the design had two real reasons, both of
    which this pool has to keep:

      1. **Parallel renders must not fight.** The large-deck section fan-out renders several
         decks at once, and two `soffice` processes pointed at ONE profile collide: measured,
         one of the pair exits 1 having written no PDF at all.
      2. **The user's own LibreOffice may be open.** A render must not touch the GUI's profile.

    So this is a POOL, not a shared singleton: N private slots, each held under an exclusive
    `flock` for the duration of one render. Concurrent renders land on different slots; a slot
    is only ever used by one process at a time, which is exactly the invariant a throwaway
    profile gave for free. Nothing here goes near LibreOffice's default profile.

    When every slot is busy, or the platform has no `flock` (Windows), or anything at all goes
    wrong, we hand back a throwaway profile — i.e. precisely the old behaviour. The pool is an
    optimization; it is never the reason a deck fails to render.

# --- parallel rasterization -------------------------------------------------------------
# Rasterizing is the one render stage that is embarrassingly parallel: each page is an
# independent draw into its own file. It is also, on an image-heavy deck, the stage that
# actually costs something.
#
# Two things about the shape below are load-bearing, both measured rather than reasoned:
#
#  1. **Chunk contiguously; open the PDF ONCE per worker.** The obvious version — one task
#     per page — was measured at 18.5s against 2.9s serial on a 16-page image deck: 6.5x
#     SLOWER, because every task re-opens and re-parses the whole PDF. Chunked, the same
#     deck rasterizes in 1.27s (4 workers).
#  2. **Never let this fail a render.** It is an optimization on a step that already worked.
#     Any failure — no process pool in a locked-down sandbox, a worker dying, pickling
#     trouble — returns False and the caller runs the original serial loop. A deck that
#     renders slower is a nuisance; a deck that does not render is a broken run.
#
# Verified byte-identical to the serial loop (sha256 over every PNG, text and image decks).
# `SLIDE_MAKER_RENDER_WORKERS=1` forces the serial path.
RASTER_MIN_PAGES = 8          # below this the pool costs more than the pages save
RASTER_MAX_WORKERS = 4        # measured: 4 workers ~= 8 workers (1.27s vs 1.25s), half the RAM
# Page COUNT was the wrong gate on its own: what a worker pool saves is DECODE work, and a page's
# decode cost is set by its weight, not by how many neighbours it has. Measured serial rasterize:
#
#     18-page text/CJK deck   2.5-5.5 KB/page,  0 images   0.05-0.08s   (2.9-4.7 ms/page)
#     16-page image deck       84.5 KB/page,   16 images   0.47s        (29.3 ms/page)
#
# Fanning out costs ~70 ms in process starts and `import fitz` per worker, so on the text decks the
# pool spent more than the whole job — measured +2.1% wall clock, i.e. the optimization ran and made
# the render slower. On the image deck it is a clear -11.4%. PDF bytes-per-page separates the two by
# ~15x, which is a wide enough margin that a threshold in the middle is not a tuned constant: below
# it there is not enough decode work to pay a single process start, whatever the page count.
# This changes only WHICH path runs; both are already asserted byte-identical by
# tests/test_render_parallel.py, so a mis-set threshold costs milliseconds and never a wrong PNG.

    The gates that guard a deck's quality — the design plan, the independent critic, the
    primary-source spot-check — are all *self-reported prose artifacts*. The model that skipped
    them is the same model that writes the hand-off note claiming they happened, so skipping is
    invisible: the note reads identically either way. This skill's own enforcement invariant
    ranks prose last for exactly that reason (deterministic lint > required-field > checklist >
    prose), yet these three sat at the bottom of it.

    So put the check where the incentive is. `--deliverables` produces the PDF and the preview
    page — the artifacts the user actually asked for — which makes it the one step nobody skips.
    Requiring evidence *here* costs nothing on a deck that ran its loop and blocks the shortcut on
    one that didn't.

    Evidence lives in `<deck-dir>/.deck-gates.json`:

        {"critic": {"verdict": "consent", "rounds": 2, "review": "reviews/r2.json"},
         "provenance": {"claims": [{"claim": "<the claim>", "verdict": "CONFIRMED",

    pass that would have skipped the refutation.)

    A gate may be waived — quick decks exist — but a waiver is a written reason that travels with
    the deck AND names which kind of skip it is, not a silence:

    # `icon_family` joins the four originals for one measured reason: a deck shipped with ZERO
    # icons through every automated gate, while a missing LOGO was caught by a required
    # checkpoint token. Icons are called a design must on every branch and had no field, no
    # column and no check anywhere. The token grammar mirrors `logo plan:` — a family name or
    # an explicit `none — <reason>` — so a deliberately icon-free deck is always satisfiable.
    # `palette` joins them for the same measured reason as `icon_family`. SKILL.md already
    # states the two-token rule -- a hue used as TEXT must itself clear 4.5:1, so keep a bright
    # FILL token and a darker TEXT twin. The rule is correct and still easy to break, because
    # the check is per-PAIR and a build touches dozens of them. Measured on one deck: the author
    # declared the rule in the design plan and then broke it FOUR times -- a vivid ochre set as a
    # label on its own pale slab (2.34:1), coral emphasis text on a coral tint (4.19:1), a table
    # highlight (4.19:1), a muted grey carrying real content on cream (4.26:1). None were
    # reckless; each was a pair nobody was thinking about while computing contrast for a
    # different pair, and each surfaced at render time or in review, a round later.
    # `scripts/palette_audit.py` resolves the whole matrix in one call, so the field is cheap to
    # fill honestly and cannot be filled at all without having run something.
    # type_scale and signature_proof were gated on the CODEX delivery path only, so on the shared
    # path typography was the one pillar of the visual language nobody had to resolve (palette,
    # icons and forms all had required fields), and the signature move was accepted as a SENTENCE
    # with nothing showing it survived into the render. That asymmetry is the exact shape of a bug
    # this repo already fixed once: the critic waiver was schema-checked for Codex and a hand-typed
    # string everywhere else, and it carried a real deck through "all gates pass".

    # `deliberately restrained: <why>` so the field is never blank either way."

    # (loads of 81-144 words against a budget of ~40), and both times the per-slide TEXT WALL
    # line was read and dismissed as advisory. The skill's OWN reference deck — the file it
    # tells every builder to copy — runs at a median of 27 words a slide, so the budget is not
    # unrealistic; what failed was that nothing made ignoring it cost anything.
