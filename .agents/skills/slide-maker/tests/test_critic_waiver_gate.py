"""The critic waiver on the shared path must be CLASSIFIED, not just written.

Script-style (`main()` + explicit exit) to match test_lint_regressions.py and the codex
suites; pytest collects nothing from this file by design, and ci.yml invokes it directly.

History this guards: the Codex delivery gate required a distinct schema-valid review artifact
per lens, while the shared path accepted `{"critic": {"waived": "<any string>"}}` and printed
one line. A hand-typed waiver carried a real 10-slide deck through "all hand-off gates pass"
with no independent critic ever involved.
